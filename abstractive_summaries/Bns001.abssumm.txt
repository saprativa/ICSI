This should just give a general sense of anything that happens
    in the meeting that you think would be a useful summary for the
    target user:  generally speaking, why are they meeting and
    what do they talk about? In most of the meetings, the group will make some decisions
    wrt the problems they discuss. In some meetings, there may be some open problems,
    or problems they come up with. In a group research meeting, they will introduce what they have done,
    ie, progress or achievements so far.
