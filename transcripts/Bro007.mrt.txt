O_K So uh today we're looking at a number of uh things we're trying and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it's visual but um got tables in front of us. Um what is - what does combo mean? So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network and then this same string of features but low-pass filtered with the low-pass filter used in the M_S_G features. And so these low-pass filtered goes through M_ eh - another M_L_P and then the linear output of these two M_L_P's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this K_L_T. Um the output is used as uh features as well. Um so let me try to restate this and see if I have it right. There is uh - there is the features uh there's the O_G_I features and then um those features um go through a contextual - uh l- l- let's take this bottom arr- one pointed to by the bottom arrow. Um those features go through a contextualized K_L_T. Yeah. Then these features also uh get um low-pass filtered Yeah so yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The graph, yeah another one. @@ Yeah, that's good. So So we have these features from O_G_I Yeah. that goes through the three paths. Three, O_K. The first is a K_L_T using several frames Yeah. of the features. Yeah. The second path is uh M_L_P also using nine frames - several frames of features Yeah. Uh-huh. The third path is this low-pass filter. Uh-huh. Uh, M_L_P Aha! aha! Adding the outputs just like in the second propose- the - the proposal from - for the first evaluation. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. And then No, the K_L_T. the K_L_T And those two together. and then the two together again. That's it. Two H_T_K. Um. O_K so that's - that's this bottom one. So this is - yeah And so uh and then the - the - the one at the top - and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they're the best? Yeah that's the reason, yeah. Oh let's focus on them then- so what's the block diagram for the one above it? For the f- the f- first yellow line you mean? Yeah. Yeah so it's uh basically s- the same except that we don't have this Step. uh low-pass filtering so we have only two streams. Well. There's - there's no low - low-pass processing Mm-hmm. used as additional feature stream. Mm-hmm. Um Do you e- um they mentioned - made some - uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they - they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers. Yeah. Uh actually the way things seems to um well it's uh forty percent for T_I-digit, sixty for all the SpeechDat-Cars, well all these languages. Ehm the well match is forty, medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty-five. Yeah. Um and we don't have the T_I-digits part yet? Uh, no. O_K. But yeah. Generally what you observe with T_I-digits is that the result are very close whatever the - the system. O_K. And so Yeah. have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that? I mean not - Uh not yet. No. O_K so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good - then we could compare the two and say what was better. Mmm yeah, yeah. Mmm. Yeah. Um and how does this compare to the numbers - oh so O_G_I two is just the top - Yeah. top row? So yeah to - actually O_G_I two is the - the baseline with the O_G_I features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they've - they're still made some changes in the features O_K. and - well but uh actually our results are better than their results. Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results O_K. Uh Uh O_K so the one - one place where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian. Yeah. Yeah. An- Yeah there is something funny happening here because - yeah. Yeah. But there are thirty-six and then sometimes we are - we are - we are around forty-two and Now up but Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a - a second um silence detection. Yeah. So there are some results here For the Italian. For this one. uh so the third and the fifth line of the table So filt is what that is? Filt, yeah Yeah. Um yeah so it seems f- for the - the well match and mismatched condition it's uh it brings something. Uh but uh actually apparently there are - there's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay. Uh Oh we can't do it. Oh O_K. well No. For that - for that we - Oh. Too bad. Uh Good idea, but can't do it. O_K. Yeah. Except I don't know because they - I think they are still working well. Uh-huh. Uh t- two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector so but yeah if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the handset and on the server side. Perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset and - but well hmm For the moment they have this large delay on the - the feature computation and O_K. So so we don't Alright so for now at least that's not there you have some results with low-pass filter cepstrum doesn't have a huge effect but it - but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places. I th- Yeah. Uh little bit. Um and um um Yeah and uh let's see What else did we have in there? Uh I guess it makes a l- um at this point this is I - I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh And you - you yellowed these out uh but uh uh Oh I see yeah that - that one you can't use because of the delay. Those look pretty good. Um let's see that one Well even the - just the - the second row doesn't look that bad right? That's just uh Yep. yeah? And - and Mmm yeah. that looks like an interesting one too. Uh Actually the - yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow except that we don't have this K_L_T on the first - on the left part of the diagram. We just have the features as they are. Mm-hmm. Um Yeah. Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better. Mm-hmm. And it's - it's - it's a little - slightly simpler. Yeah. So - so there's - so I - I would put that one also as a - as a maybe. Uh and it - yeah and it's actually does - does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian, so s- and little worse on the mis- on the M_M case, but uh Well yeah it's worse than a few things Mm-hmm. so uh let's see how that c- that c- c- see how that comes out on their - their measure and - are - are we running this uh for T_I-digits or uh Yeah. Yeah. Now is T_I di - is- is that part of the result that they get for the uh development - th- the results that they're supposed to get at the end of - end of the month, the T_I-digits are there also? Yeah. It's included, yeah. Oh O_K. O_K. And see what else there is here. Um Oh I see - the one - I was looking down here at the - the o- the row below the lower yellowed one. Uh that's Mm-hmm? uh that's with the reduced uh K_L_T size - Yeah. reduced dimensionality. Yeah. What happens there is it's around the same and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps. Yeah, it's - it's significantly worse well but - Mm-hmm. It's significantly worse - it's - Exc- except for the H_M it's uh For many a mismatch it's worse. but it's - it's mostly worse. Yeah. But it is little. I mean not - not by a huge amount, I don't know. What are - what are the sizes of any of these sets, I - I'm - I'm sure you told me before, but I've forgotten. So - you know how many words Uh are in uh one of these test sets? I don't remember. Um About? it's - it depends - well - the well matched is generally larger than the other sets and I think it's around Ye- two thousand or three thousand words perhaps, at least. But words - Hmm? well word - I don't know. The words, yeah. Sentences. S- sentences. Some sets have five hundred sentences, so. Yeah. Mmm. So the - so the sets - so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences, let's say and each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it - most of them longer or Yeah for the Italian Yeah. It - it d- even seven digits y- more or less but sometime Seven digits. the sentence have only one digit and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards, something like that. Mm-hmm. Right, so between one and sixteen. See the - I mean the reason I'm asking is - is - is we have all these small differences and I don't know Mm-hmm? how seriously to take them, right? So Yeah. uh i- if - if you had uh just you know - to give an example, if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a - a tenth of a percent would just be one word, right? So - so it wouldn't mean anything. Yeah. Yeah. Oh - um so um yeah it be kind of - I'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually. The size that we have? Yeah. We could - we could run - run some kind of significance tests or Yeah since these - well also just to know the numbers, right. So these - these are word error rates so this is on how many words. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah we have the result that the output of the H_T_K Yeah. The number of - of sentences, no it's the number isn't. Yeah sure - sure. Yeah sure. Yeah. Yeah so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then - then - that - that be great. Yeah. Um what else is there here? Um see the second - second from the bottom it says S_I_L, but this is some different kind of silence or thing or - what was that? Uh It the - the output silence of the M_L_P. Oh yeah I see. It's only one small experiment to know what happened. To apply also to in- include also the - the silence of the M_L_P we have the fifty-six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those. Yes. Uh-huh, uh-huh. The silence plus the K_L_T output? Oh so you're only using the silence. Yeah. Yeah, because when we apply the K_L_T No they're - I think there is this silence in addition to the um K_L_T outputs it is because we - we - we just keep No. in addition, yes. In addition t- uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the K_L_T and - yeah. and we not s- we are not sure if we pick - we have the silence. So we try to add the silence also in addition to the - these twenty-eight dimensions. I see. O_K. And what - and what's O_G_I forty-five? Uh it's o- it's O_G_I two, it's - so the - th- it's the features from the first line The bottom one there? It's in fact O_G_I two. and - yeah. S- Right, but I mean what's the - what does the last row mean? So it's uh basically this but without the K_L_T on the - from the left path. I thought that was the one - I thought that was the second row. So what's the difference between the second Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just uh Oh. So this is like the second line but with - with the combo stuff. Yeah. And with the - all the output of the combo. Yeah. O_K. Uh Yeah. Yeah. O_K, so - alright so it looks to me - I guess the same - given that we have to take the filt ones out of the - the running because of this delay problem - Mm-hmm. so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are - are the ones to look at but I just would add the - the - the second row one Yeah. Mmm. and then um if we can um oh yeah also when - when they're using this weighting scheme of forty, thirty-five, twenty-five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors? I guess Uh it's probably on the percentages right? I guess, yeah. Yeah O_K. I guess, yeah. Mmm. Alright. It's not clear here. O_K. Maybe - maybe they'll argue about it. Um O_K so if we can know what - how many words are in each and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there Mm-hmm. as far as they've gotten Friday and then we'll operate with that and Yeah. uh how long did it I guess if we're not doing all these things - if we're only doing um um I guess since this is development data it's legitimate to do more than one, right? Yeah. I mean ordinarily if - in final test data you don't want to do several and - and take the best that's - that's - Mmm. that's not proper but if this is development data we could still look at a couple. Yeah. We can - yeah. Sure. But we have to decide - I mean we have to fix the system on this d- on this data, to choose the best and Yeah. I- Right. these But the question is when - when do we fix the system, do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday? But we could it d- I - I think we fixed on Tuesday, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, O_K except that we do have to write it up. Also, so Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Um Uh yeah well. Well basically it's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some - some other @@ . Right so maybe what we do is we - we - we uh as soon as we get the data from them Yeah but Mm-hmm. we start the training and so forth but we start the write-up right away because as you say there - there's only minor differences between these. I think you - we could - we could start soon, yeah. Yeah. Write up something. Yeah, and - Um yeah. Mm-hmm. and I - I would - you know, I would - I'd kind of like to see it maybe I can - I can edit it a bit uh sure. The - my - what in this si- i- in this situation is my forte which is English. Yeah. Uh so Mmm. uh H- yeah. Have y- have you seen alt- d- do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything? Uh not really. O_K. Um There is the format of the table which is quite impressive. Yeah? Uh I see. Yes, for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it's not really that impressive, it's just tiny. It's all these little categories set a, set b, set c, multi-condition, clean. Uh No mitigation. Wow. Do you know what no - what no mitigation means here ? Um it should be the the problem with the error - channel error or Oh that's probably the - this is probably channel error stuff huh? Oh this is i- right, it says right above here channel - channel error resilience, yeah. well, you - Yeah. Yeah. So recognition performance is just the top part, actually. Uh and they have - yes, split between seen databases and non-seen so basically between development and - and evaluation. Yeah. And so - right, it's presumed there's all sorts of tuning that's gone on on the see- what they call seen databases and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen. Multi-condition - multi-condition. So they have - looks like they have Mm-hmm. uh uh so they splitting up between the T_I-digits and everything else, I see. So the everything else is the SpeechDat-Car, that's the Yeah, so it's not divided between languages you mean or - multi- multilingual Well, it is. It is, but there's also - there's these tables over here for the - for the T_I-digits and these tables over here for the car it just Oh yeah. data which is - which is I guess all the multilingual stuff and then uh there's - Yeah. they also split up between multi-condition and clean only. For T_I-digits. Yes. Yeah, actually yeah. For the T_I-digits they want to train on clean and on noisy Yeah. and - yeah. So we're doing that also, I guess. Uh yeah. But uh we actually - do we have the features? Yeah. For the clean T_I-digits but we did not test it yet. Uh the clean training stuff. O_K. Mmm. Well anyway, sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh Mm-hmm. Yes. next few days I guess they have to send it out - let's see the thirty-first is uh uh Wednesday and I think the - it has to be there by some hour uh European time on Wednesday so I think basically Hmm-hmm. We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because E- excuse me? that the difference in the time may be - is a long different of the time. Maybe the Thursday the twelfth of the night of the Thurs- thirty-one is - is not valid in Europe. We don't know is happening. Yeah. Yes, so I mean - I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday right because I - I think Tuesday. Yeah, well. Except if - if it's the thirty-one at midnight or I don't know - uh we can still do some work on Wednesday morning. Uh yeah well. Yeah, well. W- i- is but is - is it midni- I thought it was actually something like five P_M Yeah. Yeah. on - Mm-hmm. was like - I thought it was five P_M or something, I didn't think it was midnight. I thought they said they wanted everything by Yeah, five P_M. well, so five P_M their time is - is - if Not five P_M, three P_M. three P_M. Three P_M. Alright, that's six in the morning here. It's d- Uh no no. three - three A_- three P_M? No, we are wondering about the - the - the hour that we have to Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. eh I don't know if it's three P_M - it's Three P_M here is in Europe midnight. Yeah, it's - it's midnight but Yes, yes, but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due, I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five P_M or something. Oh O_K. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, maybe. In which case so I - I - uh well we should look but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday. Um Yeah. so then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath but then - then we'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish Yeah. but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed Yeah. so all we'll do is take whatever they have and - Yeah. and uh and run it through the process. Uh we won't be changing the training on anything Mm-hmm. so there'll be no new training, there'll just be new H_T_K runs, so that's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after - after Tuesday and - and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of Mm-hmm. uh the research. Um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on uh Mm-hmm. uh Yeah. so What? Oh, Stephane always has these great ideas and - Sure. oh, but uh we don't have time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure these are great ideas. But they're ideas. Yeah? Yeah. Oh, that was good. And - and uh also it's still true that uh Yeah. But I think it's true that - that we - we at least got fairly consistent i- improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than uh in sequence which was - was your suggestion and that - that - that seems to have been borne out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The fact that none of these are - are - you know, enormous is - is - is not too surprising - most improvements aren't enormous and Yeah. uh some of them are but uh I mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements but Mm-hmm. uh um Cuz our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from finding bugs, but Anyway O_K well I - I think - I see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there - is there anything else we should talk about or - or - are we done? Mm-hmm. I think it's O_K um. We so basically we will - I think we'll try to - to focus on these three architectures and - and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with just - just a single K_L_T because we did not really test that - removing all these K_L_T's and Uh-huh. putting one single K_L_T at the end. Yeah, I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it. Yeah. Uh if you can fit it in. Mm-hmm. Oh I have - yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too uh I don't know if we're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh I_B_M machines R_S six thousands Mm-hmm. and - and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or - I don't know, eight hundred megahertz or something and there's four processors in a box and there's ten boxes and there's some kind of ti- so if - you know he's got a lot of processing power and um we'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we wanna - wanna - wanna run them he's - he's offering it. Mm-hmm. So. It's uh when he was here eh uh he - he used i- not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell, so - so in some ways he just got his payback, but Mm-hmm. uh again I - I don't know if we'll end up with - if we're gonna be C_P_U limited on anything that we're doing in this group but - but if - if we are that's an offer. O_K well uh you guys doing great stuff so that's - that - that's really neat and uh we'll uh uh g- don't think we need to uh um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we're gonna record momentarily is starting to get - are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that's - that's another source of data. Um which is s- under somewhat better control and that we can - we can make measurements of the room the - uh that - you know if we feel there's other measurements we don't have that we'd like to have we can make them and uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago Mm-hmm. so uh that's another - another possibility for this - this kind of work. K, uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do - do our digits - do our digits duty. O_K. O_K I'll start. Three two three one dash three two five zero. Uh, let me say that again.
